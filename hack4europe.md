#3scale taking part in the largest online European Hackathon

It's not a surprise anymore that we love hackathons at 3scale. We are always excited to see hackers create incredible hacks in a short amount of time. So imagine how excited we were when the team from Hack4Europe asked us to be part of the biggest online European Hackathon ever organized. We were thrilled! :)

Part of the 3scale team is based in Barcelona, Spain, and many of our customers are in Europe too, so we are really happy to help spreading the hackathon culture on this site of the Atlantic.

##What is Hack4Europe?

After the success of Hack4France, organized last year, the organizing team decided to hold a global European competition, involving European startups and hackers.

Hackers will have 3 months between now and the 17th of May to build projects.

Projects will be divided in innovative categories. From Internet of Things to E-Commerce, with special mention of Smartcity and Energy.

During the whole hacking period, hackers will get the chance to be mentored by hacking experts as well as startup mentors. So they could improve their technicall skills as well as their entrepreneurial spirit.

In the course of the month of April, several gatherings will be organized in European capitals to get hackers together and get an overview of local projects. These events will take place in London, Paris, Berlin, Miland and Madrid.

In June the top teams will be invited to Paris for the finale, which will be held at the Ministery of Economy. The best hacks in each category will be awarded. Rumors say there might be some impressive celebrities that will stop by... 

##How is 3scale getting involved?

To help hackers achieve their goals we are happy to give them free access to APItools, our great proxy tool. (nah !?)
In the past we've seen great usage of APItools during hackathons. It's a great way to empower your project and gain a lot of time. Using APItools, hackers were able to avoid rate-limiting on APIs, get rid of CORS errors and reduce payload received by their mobile app. Find more about it [here](https://docs.apitools.com/tag/hackathon/).

During the three months of the hackathon we will also be mentoring hackers and help them with any technical questions they may have.
You will be able to meet some of the 3scale folks at the different local events as well as during the finale. Stop to say hi, they might have some unique swag for you ;)

We will give out 3 Parrot Spiders drone to the best usage of APItools.

Not to mention that one of our lovely customers: [APIdaze](http://apidaze.io) is also involved in this hackathon. Check them out!
